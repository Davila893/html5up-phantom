							<h2>Marian Rejewski</h2>
							<img src="Marian_Rejewski.jpg" alt="">
							<p>Marian Rejewski was a Polish mathematician and cryptologist who reconstructed the Nazi German military Enigma cipher machine sight-unseen in the 1932. The intelligence that was gained by the British from Enigma decrypts formed part of what was code named Ultra and contributed-perhaps decisively-to the defeat of Germany. In September 1932, Rejewski attend a secret cryptology course. Marian Rejewski deduced the machine’s secret internal wiring after only  a few weeks. He and his two colleagues then developed successive techniques for the regular decryption of Enigma message. He went silence after the war was over, but he showed his work, at the age of 74 he died of a heart attack. The Enigma machine was an electromechanical device, equipped with a 26-letter keyboard and 26 lamps, corresponding to the letters of the alphabet. Before the French came and study of Rejewski had work on the Enigma message which was mainly six letters were received a day. </p>

							<h2>Konrad Zuse</h2>
							<p>Konrad Zuse was a German Civil engineer, inventor and computer pioneer. His greatest achievement was the world's first programmable computer; His greatest achievement was the world's first programmable computer; the functional program-controlled Turing-complete Z3 became operational in May 1941. </p>


							<h2>Alan Turing</h2>
							<p> an English computer scientist, mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, and theoretical biologist.</p>


							<h2>John Napier</h2>
							<p>John Napier was a man from the 16th century. He was educated at St Andrews University at the age of 13 (He was considered an adult at this age during this time.) janet bothwell (John's’ mother) arranged were made for him to  be live in St Salvator’s college and special arrangements were made for the principle  of the university, in 1563 John Napier name appeared on the roll of st salvator’s college.</p>


							<h2>Charles Babbage</h2>
							<p>Was born during December 26, 1791. At a young age he was a his own teacher, teaching himself algebra.  When 1811, Charles Babbage went to Trinity college, cambridge. He was more advanced than his instructor. He was found reconstructing newton mathematics, later he taught at a university.  </p>


							<h2>Pong</h2>
							<p>Pong was orgianlly made from a training exerise made from allan acorn. Is an arcade tennis games from the year 1972. Pong was the first game to be manufactured by Atari.Later on ended up getting sued for it. So Ted Dabney the co-founder of Atari decided to work on it himself.  It was one of the successful home console (along with Magnavox Odyssey). Pong has inspired Atari to work on more innovative games. </p>


							<h2>ENIAC</h2>
							<p>ENIAC stands electronic numerical integrator and computers. It was the oldest technology ever made in 1964. In 1964 it had the  nickname of giant brain by the press. It contained 20,000 vacuum tubes, 7,200, 1,500 relays, 70,000 resistors, 10,000 capacitors and 5,000,000 hand-soldered joints.</p>


							<h2>Motorola</h2>
							<p>Motorola was founded in september 25th 1928 in chicago IL by Paul Galvin Joseph Galvin.  On april 3rd, 1973 motorola publicly demonstrated the world’s first portable cellular telephone and system. They called this motorola DynaTAC and it occurred in New York City.</p>


							<h2>Pascal</h2>
							<p>It has been a used world wide. Defined as one newton per square metre. It was founded by french polymath Blaise Pascal. The equation for this soultion is 1 Pa=1 N/m^2=1 kg/m(s^2)=J/m^3.</p>


							<h2>UNIX</h2>
							<p>UNIX was orginally meant to be a convenient platform for programmers developing software to be run on it and on other systems, rather than for non-programmer users. UNIX was designed to be portable, multi-user in a time-sharing configuration. But ended up being used in an academic circles, as users added their own tools to the system and shared them with colleagues.</p>

							<h2>C/C++</h2>
							<p>It was design with the bias to be for style programing. C/C++ was made by Bjarne Stroustrup during 1979</p>
